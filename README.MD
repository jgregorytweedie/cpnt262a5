               ex:   https://cpnt262a5jaydentweedie.herokuapp.com/api/v0/1
- I have an array of 5, so go from 1-5.
## ATTRIBUTIONS: 
- MY REPO FOR MONGODB: https://github.com/jgregorytweedie/mongoDB
### Comments:
- For some reason, it pops up as an error whenever i specify an ID. I think this could be because of my mongoDB? but I am not too sure. 
- when I run the home page on heroku, it works fine, and it runs fine in node.
- My best guess is is that mongoDB doesn't recognize my array of objects in my native folder, as it doesn't show up on mongoDB, although I think i have done all the correct steps?
